			<h2>Vacuum Chamber Upgrade Project</h2>
			<a class="image main"><img src="images\SpaceX.jpg" alt="" /></a>
			<p> Note:  I unfortunately can't share any photos of my work at SpaceX due to NDA</p>
			<p><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>•	To return to the Moon and go to Mars, SpaceX needed to be able to test Crew Starship hardware at partial vacuum to support the development of the HLS for NASA</p>
			<p><strong>My Contribution:</strong><br>•	Managed a project on increasing the functionality of the high-volume vacuum chamber<br>•	Gathered requirements from Stakeholders and REs and held a kickoff meeting, PDR, and CDR for the project<br>•	Designed and implemented a new control system, harnessing passthrough plate, P&ID, and Electrical Diagrams and managed relocation of the chamber 27’ 38,000lb vacuum chamber across SpaceX’s campus</p>
			<p><strong>Results:</strong><br>•	Completed the vacuum chamber upgrade project meeting requirements and supported testing of SpaceX hardware<br>•	Successfully relocated and set up the chamber without causing any damage to the system<br></p>

			<h2>Humidity Control System Media Testing</h2>
			<p><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>•	To test and measure the effectiveness of using different media to remove humidity in the Crew Starship Humidity Control System</p>
			<p><strong>My Contribution:</strong><br>•	Collected requirements from the RE on the Test Stand<br>•	Designed, manufactured, and set up various types of harnessing to support the test stand<br>•	Worked with the RE to select sensors for the test stand to interface with our test rack<br>•	Collaborated with the software team to pass down requirements and get the testbed setup<br></p>

										<h2>Spacecraft Dynamics</h2>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images\Spacecraft Dynamics Work.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I created a project to determine the pointing modes of an ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter around the planet Mars. The Orbiter is in Low Mars Orbit and had a communication satellite in Geostationary Mars Orbit to communicate with. First, the orbiter was to point its solar panels towards the Sun whenever it was on the sunny side of Mars to obtain energy for its onboard systems. Then, when the orbiter was on the dark side of Mars, it had to either point towards the GMO satellite for communications or towards the surface of Mars to observe its surface. The image above shows three frames, demonstrating all three pointing modes of the ExoMars satellite orbiting Mars.</p>

										<h2>Space Flight and Systems</h2>

									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images\Space Flight and Systems Midterm Project.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I created a ground track of an orbit for a telecommunications satellite in STK and designed code to recreate the same ground track in MATLAB.</p>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images\Space Flight and Systems Final Project.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I designed a mission for a spacecraft leaving Earth, doing a gravity assist around Jupiter, and arriving at Neptune, given initial conditions. The initial guess for the trajectory was altered by solving for a proper turning angle allowing the spacecraft to arrive at Neptune from Jupiter (shown in the images above).</p>

									<p>I conducted a preliminary structural design of a wing for a Cessna Grand Caravan EX with a team of 3 other students. We investigated expected loading conditions while comparing these to our designated factors of safety to ensure failure wouldn’t occur.</p>

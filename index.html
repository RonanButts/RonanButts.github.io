										<h2>Spacecraft Dynamics</h2>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images\Spacecraft Dynamics Work.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I created a project to determine the pointing modes of an ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter around the planet Mars. The Orbiter is in Low Mars Orbit had a communication satellite in Geostationary Mars Orbit to communicate with. For the Orbiter, three pointing modes were to be exercised depending on its position. First, the orbiter was to point its solar panels towards the Sun whenever it was on the sunny side of Mars to obtain energy for its onboard systems. Then, when the orbiter was on the dark side of Mars, it had to either point towards the GMO satellite for communications or towards the surface of Mars to observe its surface. The image above shows three frames, demonstrating all three pointing modes of the ExoMars satellite orbiting Mars.</p>

										<h2>Space Flight and Systems</h2>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images\Space Flight and Systems Midterm Project.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I created a ground track of an orbit for a telecommunications satellite in STK and designed code to recreate the same ground track in MATLAB.</p>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images\Space Flight and Systems Final Project.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I designed a mission for a spacecraft leaving Earth, doing a gravity assist around Jupiter, and arriving at Neptune, given initial conditions. The initial guess for the trajectory was altered by solving for a proper turning angle allowing the spacecraft to arrive at Neptune from Jupiter (shown in the images above).</p>

									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images\Aerospace Structures Work.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I conducted a preliminary structural design of a wing for a Cessna Grand Caravan EX with a team of 3 other students. We investigated expected loading conditions while comparing these to our designated factors of safety to ensure failure wouldn’t occur.</p>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images\Intro to Aerospace Glider Design.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I led a team of 5 in a glider design project. In the project, we researched airfoils, did analyses of the airfoils in XFLR5, selected a design from this analysis, and created a model of our glider.  </p>
